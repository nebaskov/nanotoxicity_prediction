            <h2>Using magnetic nanoparticles in MRI and hyperthermia treatment</h2>
            <h4>
                Medical treatments using magnetic nanoparticles have already shown prospective results in
                clinic practice. As an example, Feridex® and Resovist® have been approved as magnetic resonance
                imagining (MRI) contrast agents for liver imagining; several other magnetic nanoparticles for MRI have
                undergone various stages of clinical trials. The reason for this is using magnetic nanoparticles as MRI
                contrast agents detailed images of different tissues can be obtained that makes diagnosis of lesions more
                accurate. Moreover, magnetic nanoparticles have recently been used in medical trials for hyperthermia
                treatment glioblastoma, prostate and pancreatic cancer. It is possible because in this process cells undergo
                heat stress so apoptosis, signal transduction and protein expression can be controlled. Using magnetic
                nanoparticles in biomedical applications is possible thanks to the fact that performance of magnetic
                nanoparticles in biomedical applications can be controlled adjusting size, shape, surface, composition of
                nanoparticles and parameters of applied electromagnetic field.<br>
                Detailed information can be found in the relevant review articles on the application of magnetic
                nanoparticles in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/C7CS00316A">MRI</a>
                and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nantod.2017.02.006">hyperthermia</a>.

                Dataset was formed during the data processing that includes implementation of new descriptors using initial
                parameters, correlation matrix analysis, removing outliers and filling of missing data.<br>
                SAR and r<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub> relaxivities were chosen as predictive parameters because they reflect performance of nanoparticles in
                hyperthermia treatment or MRI. They depend on many factors, so essential parameters were extracted from articles and
                using them some derivative descriptors were calculated. All descriptors in the database reflect the composition of
                core as average magnetic moment of core metals; composition of surface as spin of surface atoms, number of H
                acceptors and LogP for organic coating molecules; shape as maximum to
                minimum length ratio; size and surface fraction as surface area volume ratio; magnetic properties of nanoparticle
                as coercivity, remanent and saturation magnetizations; experimental conditions as field strength, amplitude and
                frequency, concentration of nanoparticles.

            <h2>Prediction limitations</h2>
                <h4>It is important to underline the current limitations of ML models to define robustness
                    f predictions using new samples and to understand what data is needed to improve the model performance.
                    First of all, most of the data in the database are ferrites with different compositions, so predictions
                    properties of other types of materials may be more inaccurate. The prevalent distribution of parameters in
                    the database is non-Gaussian, so algorithms predict biomedical characteristics of nanomaterials with high
                    accuracy in areas of the highest probability density of descriptors (see Data Analysis in Methods). Moreover,
                    descriptors used in this work do not describe all aspects of a given system. For example, because of lack of
                    data such descriptors as hydrodynamic radius or zeta-potential were not used so behavior of nanoparticles in
                    the environment was not taken into account. Shell thickness is an important parameter that influences the
                    properties of magnetic nanoparticles, however because of few articles with measurements of this value, this
                    descriptor was not used. Worth saying that all data used by ML models was collected from in vitro measurements,
                    so these models do not reflect behavior of magnetic nanoparticles in vivo at all. For prediction of values in
                    more complex biological systems, a large quantity of descriptors taking into account the huge number of
                    interactions in the body must be used. Thus, there is a need for a thorough characterization of experiments in
                    scientific articles for better quality of data and development of more complex descriptors for ML models.
